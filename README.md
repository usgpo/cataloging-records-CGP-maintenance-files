# CGP Maintenance

## General Information

Metadata and Collection Services (MCS), formerly Library Technical Services (LTS), of Library Services & Content Management (LSCM), [United States Government Publishing Office (GPO)](https://www.gpo.gov) developed and maintains this repository. This repository offers files of MARC bibliographic records of the [Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP)](https://catalog.gpo.gov/F) for downloading free of charge. The CGP is the GPO’s finding tool for publications of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches, and other entities of the U.S. Federal Government. The CGP records comprise the National Bibliography of U.S. Government Publications and contain descriptive and subject information to enable the discovery of these resources. Many CGP records provide PURL (persistent uniform resource locator) links to the online versions of publications. For more information, please visit the [CGP help pages](https://catalog.gpo.gov/cgphelp/en/help.html).

In conjunction with the CGP Records Monthly Files collection, LSCM produces an annual set of files of the new and changed CGP records of each calendar year. MCS generally posts the files of the records during the following February. MCS posts the files in these repositories: [All CGP Records (MARC)](https://github.com/usgpo/cataloging-records-all-cgp-utf8) and [All CGP Records (MARC XML)](https://github.com/usgpo/cataloging-records-all-cgp-marcxml). MCS retains the monthly files in the [CGP Records Monthly Files](https://github.com/usgpo/cataloging-records-CGP-maintenance-files/tree/main/CGP_Records_Monthly_Files) collection of this repository posted during the year between each annual set of all CGP records.

The collections in this repository include files that can be used for cataloging/metadata maintenance and collection management purposes, such as adding new records, replacing changed records, and removing records that LSCM deleted from the CGP.

The collections contain one or more of these resources:

- MARC record files
  - MARC UTF-8
  - MARC XML
  - MARC-8
- CSV files of multiple major metadata elements of the records
- PDFs of multiple major metadata elements of the records and the titles linked to the PURLs and the CGP record numbers link to the records
- Record display pages of several major metadata elements and the titles linked to the PURLs and the CGP numbers linked to the records
